# Project Happy Thoughts API

The assignment was to create a backend for the happy thoughts API using Mongoose, MongoDB and Heroku

## The problem

Tech used:
> Mongoose
> MongoDB
> Mongo Cloud Atlas for database hosting
> Heroku for server hosting
> Postman for testing

I had a sub-optimal week this week due to personal reasons, so I went for basic requirements. If I had more time I would have added hashtags and user data fields, among other things.
